Hybrids often originate as zoomorphic deities who, over time, are given an anthropomorphic aspect. Some creatures were given wings, some with lion heads, etc. Worshipping unknown aspects of nature and animals, was part of many religions
                  and pagan beliefs. Before the industrial revolution, mostly it was animals and nature that hid the unknown in itself, terrified or extorted respect. Merging with animals gave us extra info/ data or abilities.
                  Shortly afterwards the world got fascinated with technology, mechanization and the machinery that could have dominated us. We stepped into the era of fearful machinery and robots. The unknown was what frightened us and also created a basis for longing for extra-powers or abilities, to
                  maybe in a way dominate the fear of the unknown.

                  Modern Hybrids aren’t animalistic anymore, they are non-human, with still or other artificial extracts from their bodies, something in between human- machine, animal-machine, machine-machine (Donna Haraway). Replaced or additional parts, still have significance, something that is enchanted,
                  scientifically proven. My interest is to search and understand how to create new kinds of Myths around Hybrids. What is this new methodology with technology and how can we manipulate devices or body extensions with that. <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 10px; font-family: sans-serif;">Can we go back to animalistic agency and merge with nature? What tools can I use ( creating a collage or VR game or generating them ), Is it possible to create hybrids that connect to each other in any type of way, for example clench like magnets together? Is it possible to create Myths that create new heroes or teach us something new about the world around us? Those Hybrids in new methodologies can become hoarders of parts either body, animal body or machinery, architecture, etc. Or maybe on the other hand creating bodies that devour each other’s pieces as they come
                  closer in virtual reality, showing carelessness in the society towards each other’s needs and accomplishments? Main purpose is to find connections in society through research and create new Myths based on new Hybrid stories.</p>

Hybrids often originate as zoomorphic deities who, over time, are given an anthropomorphic aspect. Some creatures were given wings, some with lion heads, etc. Worshipping unknown aspects of nature and animals, was part of many religions
                  and pagan beliefs. Before the industrial revolution, mostly it was animals and nature that hid the unknown in itself, terrified or extorted respect. Merging with animals gave us extra info/ data or abilities.
                  Shortly afterwards the world got fascinated with technology, mechanization and the machinery that could have dominated us. We stepped into the era of fearful machinery and robots. The unknown was what frightened us and also created a basis for longing for extra-powers or abilities, to
                  maybe in a way dominate the fear of the unknown.

                  Modern Hybrids aren’t animalistic anymore, they are non-human, with still or other artificial extracts from their bodies, something in between human- machine, animal-machine, machine-machine (Donna Haraway). Replaced or additional parts, still have significance, something that is enchanted,
                  scientifically proven. My interest is to search and understand how to create new kinds of Myths around Hybrids. What is this new methodology with technology and how can we manipulate devices or body extensions with that. <p style="font-weight: bold;font-size: 10px; font-family: sans-serif;">Can we go back to animalistic agency and merge with nature? What tools can I use ( creating a collage or VR game or generating them ), Is it possible to create hybrids that connect to each other in any type of way, for example clench like magnets together? Is it possible to create Myths that create new heroes or teach us something new about the world around us? Those Hybrids in new methodologies can become hoarders of parts either body, animal body or machinery, architecture, etc. Or maybe on the other hand creating bodies that devour each other’s pieces as they come
                  closer in virtual reality, showing carelessness in the society towards each other’s needs and accomplishments? Main purpose is to find connections in society through research and create new Myths based on new Hybrid stories.</p>
